# Sven-Co-op-Scripts

A lot of stuff i did for the game Sven Co-op.

You are allowed to do whatever you want but for **map_scripts** do not repack these scripts "as-is"

If you own a outdated script it will probably broke in a future if i do update the shared scripts at ``scripts/mikk``

The ``"/mikk/"`` folder is reserved for this repository to be always updated. copy ``scripts/mikk/`` folder and the scripts you need within a folder of your own.
